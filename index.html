            Visual Studio Code is made by Microsoft. You can download it from https://code.visualstudio.com/Download. Download Windows or Mac depending which platform you're on. I recommend you get the "Live Server" extention.

            You can access console screen by right clicking the screen. Then, you click the tab that says "Console". You can print aything in the console if you do console.log(). Put what you want to say in the parentheses.
